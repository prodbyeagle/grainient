# Grainient

A library for generating gradients with grain effects on canvas.

## Installation

To install the library, run:

npm install grainient
```

## Usage

To use the library in your project, import and initialize it with your desired settings. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the `initializeCanvas` function:

```javascript
import { generateGradientWithGrain } from 'grainient';

const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

// Generate a gradient with grain effect
generateGradientWithGrain(ctx, canvas.width, canvas.height, '#ff0000', '#0000ff', 10);
```

## API

### `initializeCanvas(canvas, color1, color2, grainIntensity, text, textSize)`

- **`canvas`**: The HTML canvas element to initialize.
- **`color1`**: The start color of the gradient (HEX color code, e.g., `#ff0000`).
- **`color2`**: The end color of the gradient (HEX color code, e.g., `#0000ff`).
- **`grainIntensity`**: The intensity of the grain effect (a number between 0 and 50).
- **`text`**: Optional. The text to draw on the canvas.
- **`textSize`**: Optional. The font size for the text in pixels (default is 40).

## Examples

### Basic Gradient

```javascript
import { generateGradientWithGrain } from 'grainient';

const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
generateGradientWithGrain(ctx, canvas.width, canvas.height, '#ff0000', '#0000ff', 10);
```
